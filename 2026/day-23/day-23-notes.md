# Task 1: Understanding Branches
---

### What is a branch in Git?
- A branch is a parallel line of development. It allows developers to build features without affecting the main branch.

### Why do we use branches instead of committing everything to main?
- To avoid risk of breaking stable code in the main branch

### What is HEAD in Git?
- HEAD is a pointer to the currently checked-out branch/commit.
  
### What happens to your files when you switch branches?
